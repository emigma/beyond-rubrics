A project of &nbsp; ![Image](/assets/images/logo-TSL.jpg) &nbsp; & &nbsp; ![Image](/assets/images/logo-makered.png) with Albemarle County School District, Portola Valley School District, & San Mateo County Office of Education

*This site is a companion to seven tools that comprise the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit.  For an overview of the project, [visit the project webpage](https://tsl.mit.edu/projects/beyond-rubrics/).*

## **The Beyond Rubrics Toolkit** - designed to investigate:

### What might embedded assessment in maker activities look like?

Is it **multidimensional** and **hands-on**? [See Stereocraft >>](/stereocraft/www.md)

Or is it **digital**, capturing **student voice** in high-def? [See Reflection Collection >>](/reflection-collection/www.md)

Might it resemble a biologist doing **field research**, or a detective **examining evidence**?  [See Field Guide >>](/field-guide/www.md)

Or does it look like a **friendly game** of ultimate frisbee, baseball, or bingo? [See Maker Moments >>](/maker-moments/www.md)

Is it woven into the **classroom culture**, with special vocabulary and role models? [See Superpower Sleuth >>](/superpower-sleuth/www.md)

Does it let us see the **process-driven, open-ended and youth-centered** qualities of maker education, along with students' **content learning**?
